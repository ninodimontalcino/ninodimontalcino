I am a research intern at `MILA ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦`.  My research interest centers around the causal perspective on machine learning with a focus on credit assignment, representation learning and reinforcement learning. I did my masters and bachelors in computer science at `ETH ZÃ¼rich ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡­` and worked in my master's thesis within a collaboration between `ETH ZÃ¼rich ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡­`, `MPI TÃ¼bingen ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª` and `MILA ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦` on active causal structure learning. Previously, I did a diploma (vocational education) in computer science and worked multiple years as a systems engineer.
