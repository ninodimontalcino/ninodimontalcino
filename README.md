I am a master's student in computer science at `ETH ZÃ¼rich` with an interest in the intersection of causality and machine learning. Currently, I am working on my master's thesis within a collaboration between `ETH ZÃ¼rich ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡­`, `MPI TÃ¼bingen ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª` and `MILA ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦` on causal structure learning.
